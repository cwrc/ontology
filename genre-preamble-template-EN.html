    <h1>CWRC Genre Ontology Preamble</h1>

    <h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
    <p>The CWRC Genre Ontology was developed by the Canadian Writing Research Collaboratory (<a href="http://www.cwrc.ca/en">cwrc.ca</a>) to identify genres associated with various forms of cultural production, particularly literary production. It is designed to enable both the classification of specific items and to enable discussions of genres as concepts.</p>

     <h2 id="introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
     
     <p>This is a linked data representation of the genre vocabulary of the Canadian Writing Research Collaboratory (CWRC). The genre vocabulary of the Orlando Project has been substantially extended to reflect more fully the vocabularies of other projects, as well as aspects of materiality and form. It has three major groups of terms associated with medium, form, and genre. Although form and genre can bleed into one another, we concieve of form in relation to material characteristics, and genre in terms of content, style, or purpose. It includes literary genres associated with the literary tradition in English, broadly conceived, as well as related genres that often interact with literature or that are frequently subjected to literary analysis. We welcome suggestions of additions and improvements from related projects wishing to use the vocabulary.</p>
     
     <h2 id="background">2. Background</h2>
     <p>Genre, Carolyn R.  Miller contends in an influential article, does
     not inhere in “substance or form of discourse” but must rather be
     conceived of in terms of situationally-specific rhetorical action,
     although her definition is more complicated than this brief
     articulation would suggest, since she argues that “action encompasses
     both substance and form” (151,152).</p> 
     
     <p>Two primary types of action are associated with genre.  Miller addresses how particular speech acts
     or instances of discourse, that is, texts in a broad sense, come
     themselves to embody generic features; these, she argues, emerge from
     rhetorical situations which are social constructs by which private
     intentions are translated into socially recognizable and interpretable
     discursive acts (Miller 1984).  But there is also the act of applying a
     generic label to a text, another kind of discursive act that operates
     in a wide range of contexts for different purposes.  Generic
     categorization is foundational to a wide range of disciplines, and most of all to literary and cultural studies, in which generic categorization organizes both
     primary and secondary materials, defines specializations and literary
     movements, and plays a major role in the organization and
     articulation of literary theory, criticism, and history.  As a major
     feature of library classification systems, genre labeling serves
     research across the disciplines. It organizes bookstores and
     publishers’ lists, and is used by readers to share and discuss their
     tastes in texts.</p> 
     
     <p>Within these wide-ranging contexts, methods of
     categorizing specific texts by genre fall into a spectrum ranging from
     the application by professional cataloguers of tightly controlled
     authoritative vocabularies produced by “trusted sources” (Harper),
     though to entirely folksonomic categories devised ad hoc by users of
     online systems--what Clay Shirky has described as “a radical break with
     previous categorization strategies, rather than an extension of them.”
     Numerous studies have indicated that while the terms deployed in these
     various contexts may overlap, they are not consistently applied
       (Lester; Lu; Rolla).</p>  
     <p>This is the understanding of genre that informs this ontology. It does not claim to have arrived at a definitive taxonomy of literary forms, and considers such a taxonomy to be impossible. Rather, it represents a pragmatic approach to media, form, and genre, very broadly conceived. Its particular emphasis on literary genre emerges from a scholary history of women's writing. The creators recognize that other languages and approaches will emerge from other contexts, and hope the structure will prove flexible and extensible enough to server other types of projects. In a Linked Open Data (LOD) environment, various approaches to genre will necessarily intersect, collide, and otherwise interact. We welcome the prospect of ongoing expansion, revision, and linking of this ontology to other vocabularies, as the Canadian Writing Research Collaboratory continues to grow in conversation with the LOD community.</p>
     
     <h2 id="datasources">3. Data sources</h2>
     
     <p>The genre instances within this ontology are based on the intersection of
     the genres originally listed by the Orlando Project with the metadata schema and additional terms required by other projects hosted by the Canadian Writing Research Collaboratory.</p>
     <p>Definitions of the genres used have been adopted, adapted, or created so as to provide guidance in the application of the terms. Where possible, these were adapted from the linked open
     data sets of DBpedia/Wikipedia, the Getty Art &amp; Architecture Thesaurus, or from the <i><a href="http://web.cn.edu/kwheeler/lit_terms.html">Literary Terms and
     Definitions</a></i> webpage of  
     Dr. L. Kip Wheeler. The indebtedness of the description is indicated using
     the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/">provenance ontology</a>, inline html citations, and within
     &lt;rdfs:comment&gt;
     tags, depending on the degree of alignment with the original definition. That said, these definitions can only act as imperfect guides to an understanding of a particular genre, given the complex and situated operation of genre outlined above.</p> 
     
     <h2 id="taxonomy">4. Structure</h2>
       <p>Some approaches to genre make each term a class that can be applied to an object, whereas others provide instances for each genre. In order to facilitate the ability both to apply terms to particular cultural productions and enable them to be discussed as concepts, genres  within the CWRC Genre ontology are instances rather than classes, and are related to particular cultural works through the <a href="genre.html#hasGenre"> property.</p><p>Because it is useful for a number of purposes to be able to move between broader genres and more specific ones, the ontology organizes its terms through a combination of <a href="https://www.w3.org/OWL/">OWL</a> classes that provide broad groupings and
       <a href="https://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/">SKOS</a> taxonomical relations amongst instances. The OWL classes provide the ability to reason from narrower to broader terms, while the SKOS properties
       provide more limited transitive narrower/broader relationships between the instances themselves that can be used
       to search for relevant works according to those taxonimicaL relationships amongst instances. One distinctive feature of the ontology is its use of adjectives, as in the class &apos;Philosophical Genre&apos; and the instance &apos;detective&apos; to denote types of cultural objects. The classe group multiple genres that fall under that category, while the instance terms can be employed in conjunction with genres that relate more to form, such as &apos;poem&apos; or &apos;novel&apos;, so as to denote, for instance, &apos;detective novel&apos;.</p>
       <!--
       <p><a href="figures/genreTaxonomy-ONTOLOGY_DATE-EN.svg">The specific taxonomy is:</a></p>
       <object type="image/svg+xml" id="genre-tax" data="figures/genreTaxonomy-ONTOLOGY_DATE-EN.svg"></object> 
        --> 
       
     <h2 id="usingthisontology">5. Using this ontology</h2>

     <p>This ontology was constructed to support the efforts of the CWRC project while enabling its stand-alone use by outside projects. Terms
     exist as typed instances of either the <a href="#Genre">&lt;Medium&gt;</a>, <a href="#Genre">&lt;Form Genre&gt;</a>, or <a href="#Genre">&lt;Genre&gt;</a> classes or one of their subclasses. 
     <!-- add back in if confirmed
     , as well as
     <a href="https://www.w3.org/2009/08/skos-reference/skos.html#Concept">&lt;skos:Concept&gt;</a>s
     of a Genre <a href="https://www.w3.org/2009/08/skos-reference/skos.html#ConceptScheme">&lt;ConceptScheme&gt;</a>. -->
     Instances can be accessed directly, via the OWL classes relations, or
     through the built-in SKOS taxonomical properties. The property
     <a href="genre.html#hasGenre">&lt;genre:hasGenre&gt;</a> with no <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/owl-ref/#domain-def">&lt;rdfs:domain&gt;</a>
     permits the easy assignment of a genre to a work without committing to
     a specific type of creative work.</p>
      <p>This ontology can be paired with the <a href="http://sparql.cwrc.ca/">CWRC ontology</a> or used independently. The CWRC team welcomes suggestions for additions to and refinement of this Genre ontology via its <a href="https://github.com/cwrc/ontology">code repository</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="notesSKOS">6. Translations of definitions</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Definitions in French, English (and other serendipitously available languages) are never word for word translations and are definitions in their own right, serving to illustrate further the complexity of genre.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2 id="conclusion">7. Future Development</h2>
    <p>
    The basic structure of this ontology should be considered stable. Like other CWRC ontologies, this is a living ontology to which changes will be made as new needs and use-cases arise. 
     <!-- Deprecated changes will be noted from version 0.6 (completion of the restructuring to introduce the OWL classes) onwards. -->
    The ontology will continue to be developed as new projects require additional terms, as it is crosswalked more thoroughly with other vocabularies, and as the CWRC team and related projects explore the implications of a multilingual ontology dedicated to medium, form, and genre. Feedback and suggestions are welcome.</p>

family was from Portugal. GA was English by birth, and she was full of praise for her country as a land of tolerance and freedom: England offers a rest and home 
of perfect freedom to the exile and oppressed . . . . Much of her writing about Jews served to counter the claims of those such as Thomas Carlyle, who argued that
Jews could not be fully loyal to any country except Zion. GA's writings treat in detail the Jewish faith to which she strongly adhered, and she often focuses on
the persecution and prejudice which Jews suffered throughout the nineteenth century, as well as historically. As critic Michael Galchinsky argues, the practices
and culture of crypto-Judaism, whereby Jews evaded the Inquisition by passing for Catholic while retaining their ancestral faith in private, considerably influenced
both the form and content of her work. Despite her intense commitment to improving the standing of her people through her writing, her friend Anna Maria Hall
avers that she and her husband could only with difficulty get GA to speak on religious topics and were quite unacquainted with her religious habits.
However, her continuing dedication to Judaism, and her identification of herself with her Sephardic Jewish heritage—which she also considered a nationality
—was obvious to those who knew her, and she may have been a proto-Zionist the natural and unaffected eloquence of her words, when referring to the past history

praise and prayer where necessary to accord with her own—and came to the conclusion that Christianity and Judaism had much in common in spirit, even
 if they diverged in form. She later argued in Sabbath Thoughts that Christianity was the Kingdom of Iron prophesied by Daniel, which would prepare
for the Jewish messiah. Her lack of adequate religious education meant that she frequently had to rely on Christian texts about Judaism. Critic
Beth-Zion Lask Abrahams joins some contemporary critics in calling her a Jewish Protestant; however, others have argued that though she was reformist,
she was a dedicated Jew nonetheless, and above all.""" ;

family was from Portugal. GA was English by birth, and she was full of praise for her country as a land of tolerance and freedom: England offers a rest and home 
of perfect freedom to the exile and oppressed . . . . Much of her writing about Jews served to counter the claims of those such as Thomas Carlyle, who argued that
Jews could not be fully loyal to any country except Zion. GA's writings treat in detail the Jewish faith to which she strongly adhered, and she often focuses on
the persecution and prejudice which Jews suffered throughout the nineteenth century, as well as historically. As critic Michael Galchinsky argues, the practices
and culture of crypto-Judaism, whereby Jews evaded the Inquisition by passing for Catholic while retaining their ancestral faith in private, considerably influenced
both the form and content of her work. Despite her intense commitment to improving the standing of her people through her writing, her friend Anna Maria Hall
avers that she and her husband could only with difficulty get GA to speak on religious topics and were quite unacquainted with her religious habits.
However, her continuing dedication to Judaism, and her identification of herself with her Sephardic Jewish heritage—which she also considered a nationality
—was obvious to those who knew her, and she may have been a proto-Zionist the natural and unaffected eloquence of her words, when referring to the past history 
of the Jews . . . and the positive radiance of her countenance when she spoke of the gathering of the tribes at Jerusalem, could never be forgotten.""" ;

persecuted her family on the Continent. She made Christian friends with whom she discussed religious issues, attended church—she altered the forms of 
praise and prayer where necessary to accord with her own—and came to the conclusion that Christianity and Judaism had much in common in spirit, even
 if they diverged in form. She later argued in Sabbath Thoughts that Christianity was the Kingdom of Iron prophesied by Daniel, which would prepare
for the Jewish messiah. Her lack of adequate religious education meant that she frequently had to rely on Christian texts about Judaism. Critic
Beth-Zion Lask Abrahams joins some contemporary critics in calling her a Jewish Protestant; however, others have argued that though she was reformist,
she was a dedicated Jew nonetheless, and above all.""" ;

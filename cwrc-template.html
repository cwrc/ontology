    <h3 id="introduction">1. Introduction</h3> 
    <p>Although it contains quite general components for activities such as annotation
    and citation, its focus is on describing and relating aspects literary studies and literary history, with a strong emphasis
    on gender and intersectional analysis indebted to its roots in <a href="http://www.artsrn.ualberta.ca/orlando/">The Orlando
    Project</a>, a history of women’s writing in the
    British Isles.  It links to a number of standards while attempting to indicate the complexity of the relationship between
    representation and provenance in the production of linked data, and to convey the situatedness (<a
    href="#haraway_situated_1988">Haraway, 1988</a>) of the knowledge
    that it represents.</p>
    
    <p>Some of the materials associated with this ontology are produced natively by activities conducted within the Collaboratory.
    Others are produced through a process of translation from embedded XML markup. In other words, some are the product of human
    creation or curation, and others are generated by machine.
    </p>
    <h3 id="status">2. Status of this Document</h3>
    <p>This document is a human readable version of the ontology that cannot document all of the data structures within the
    ontology, which should be the primary source for understanding how the ontology works.</p>

    <h3 id="status_ontology">3. Status of this dynamic ontology</h3>
     <p>This document and the associated ontology will grow iteratively with modification made over time according to the amount
     of data translated and the ontological issues located over time. Continuity is ensured using the OWL ontology annotations
     for ontological compatibility and for deprecated classes and properties. Deprecated ontology terms remain present but are
     marked as such.</p>

    <h3 id="background">4. Background on the Orlando source data</h3>
    <p>

    The Orlando Project embarked in 1995 on a history of women’s writing in the
    British Isles from the beginnings to the present (<a href="#brown_story_2007">Brown, Clements et al., 2007a</a>;<a
    href="#brown_introduction_2007">Brown, Clements et al., 2007b</a>).  This born-digital collaboration devised a knowledge
    representation (<a href="#susan_brown_sorting_2006">Brown, Clements et al., 2006</a>) in the form of a bespoke SGML
    tagset to encode the priorities and concepts in the text as it was being
    written.  This tagset structures the biocritical, chronological, and
    bibliographical content of the resulting history of more than 8 million
    words and 2 million tags.  The schema formed the basis of the Canadian
    Writing Research Collaboratory’s schema for similar content, and provides
    the foundation of the ontology provided here.  The ontology design responds
    to the challenges of shifting from semi-structured to structured data
    (<a href="#james_smith_working_2013">Smith, 2013</a>).</p>
    
    <p><i>Orlando: Women’s Writing in the British Isles from the Beginnings to the

    <h3 id="goals">5. Basic ontological goals</h3>

    <h4 id="principals">a. Principles</h4>

    <p>The schema covers entities, classes, and relationships associated with
    the domains of literature and literary as understood from a feminist
    intersectional perspective. The ontology design responds to the challenges
    of shifting from semi-structured to structured data (<a href="#james_smith_working_2013">Smith, 2013</a>). Although
    linked data triples stand on their own formally, many are derived from
    discursive prose and are best read in an environment that links back to
    their original context. The CWRC ontology design avoids representing RDF
    extractions from Orlando data as positivist assertions, and yet produces
    machine-readable OWL/RDF-compliant graph structures. It allows references
    to, without endorsing, external ontological vocabularies that are
    nevertheless part of documenting intersectional cultural processes and
    identities.</p>

    <h4 id="linkages">b. Linkages to other ontologies</h4>
    
    <p>We employ a number of strategies for linking to other ontologies.  Our
    architecture does not import other ontologies wholesale, but relates to
    large vocabularies in defined ways.  We try not to abuse sameAs predicates
    (<a href="#halpin_when_2010">Halpin, Hayes et al., 2010</a>).  We adopt external namespaces and associated
    classes and terms wherever possible when they are in widespread use and
    their vocabularies are broadly compatible with ours, as in the case of the
    foaf and bibo vocabularies.  For some terms such as those for religious
    denominations or genres, we are happy to draw on other vocabularies’ terms
    and definitions in part or in whole for ours, as in the case of terms from
    the <a href="#_getty_2017">Getty Art and Architecture Thesaurus</a> (<a href="http://www.getty.edu/research/index.html">Getty Research
    Institute</a>).  Other
    terms are referenced but at one remove.  This is particularly common in
    relation to the vocabulary associated with Cultural Formation (see below),
    which is understood primarily as representational, and within which identity
    terms are typed as labels and related to other internal narrower instances of labels
    that indicate the intersection of that term with one or more type of
    identity categorization. These are in turn related to external ontologies
    as subclasses, with a view to indicating that, although related, the
    terms and their definitions are not commensurate
    with those used in the CWRC vocabulary. By means of this structure, our
    vocabulary positions all terms associated with processes of Cultural
    Formation as in effect labels, retaining the ambiguity of terms that
    draw together identity categories.</p>

 
    <p>Vocabulary reuse presented some challenges to the CWRC in that the
    specific intent of vocabularies is not always recorded and thus
    ambiguity in the intent of the author makes their reuse difficult. A
    typical example is that of religion where much ambiguity exists as to
    whether the term actually represents 
    the religion as a belief system, the underlying religious organization, 
    the social behaviours it implies or any combination of the above.</p>
    <p>A the top level the CWRC ontology makes use of the following well know
    ontologies:
    <ol>
     <li>The FOAF ontology for the representation of people and
     organizations.</li>
     <li>The BIBO ontology for the representation of bibliographic data.</li>
     <li>The TIME ontology for the representation of events and points in
     time where ISO8601/XML Schema times are not appropriate.</li>
     <li>The NIF-CORE ontology is used to contain and manipulate the text of
     the original Orlando entries.</li>
     <li>The Open Annotation Ontology is used to link the original Orlando
     text to specific <a href="#Context">Context</a>s.</li>
     <li>The SKOS vocabulary is use to represent taxonomical relationships
     within certain <a href="#CulturalFormation">Cultural Formation<a/>s and
     to fully document ontology terms.</li>
     <li>Some Dublin Core vocabulary terms are used for well known documentation
     tags such as &lt;dc:title&gt;.
    </ol>
    </p>    


    <h4 id="provenance">c. Provenance and contexts</h4>

    <p>
    As noted above, some data associated with this ontology has been generated
    from XML structures (<a href="#brown_curious_2013">Simpson and Brown,
    2013</a>). Provenance is thus
    particularly important, given that the data was not produced natively in
    RDF but rather in the form of tags embedded in a discursive context. In
    such cases, the relevant portions of the text are provided in the form of
    snippets, which within the dataset become instances of contextual notes or human-readable
     annotations to which the ontological classes are directly tied.     
    </p>    

    <p>The wholesale import of entire vocabularies within the CWRC ontology
    was likely to cause logical and ontological issues. To this end, we
    opted not to use the &lt;owl:import&gt; construct and to either
    link to vocabularies externally or to clone specific sets of terms from
    selected vocabularies. Similarly, not all ontologies are well-defined
    but drawing from their narrative or some of their properties prouved
    usefull. To this end, we avoided the use of &lt;owl:sameAs&gt; so as not
    to bring in unintended properties or ontological structures into the
    cwrc ontology. In other cases, the Provenance ontology property
    &lt;prov:derivedFrom&gt; is used to indicate that the term was
    constructed using information from other terms without necessarily being
    equivalent. Direct linkages to other ontologies is usually done through
    the use of subClasses or &lt;owl:equivalentClass&gt;.</p>

    <h4 id="labelsandvalues">d. Labels and values</h4>
    <p>
     As noted above, labels are not only used here to indicate the particular
     terms associated with an element of the ontology, but to indicate, when
     used to type a class, its representationality or discursiveness.
    </p>
    <h4 id="culturalformationsgeneric">e. Cultural Formations</h4>

    <p>
    Cultural diversity has been an increasing source of debate beyond and
    within the digital humanities community. The concentration within the
    Debates in Digital Humanities series (<a href="#matthew_k._gold_debates_2012">Gold, 2012</a>; <a
    href="#matthew_k._gold_debates_2016">Gold and Klein, 2016</a>) of
    pieces reflecting the increasing prominence of matters related to race,
    gender, cultural diversity and difference is but one marker of the extent
    to which diversity matters. This ontology seeks to convey an intersectional
    understanding of identity categories, as instantiated in The Orlando
    Project’s XML Biography schema. 
    
    The Cultural Formation portion of the ontology recognizes categorization as
    endemic to social experience, while incorporating variation in terminology
    and the contextualization of identity categories.  It understands social
    classification as culturally produced, intersecting, and discursively
    embedded. We invoke categories as the grounds for cultural investigation
    rather than fixed classifications, since such categories have never been
    stable or mutually exclusive (<a href="#mark_algee-hewitt_representing_2016">Algee-Hewitt, Porter, and Walser, 2016</a>)
    For a more detailed explication of cultural formation, see <a href="#brown_cultural_2017">Brown et al 2017</a>.
    </p> 

    <h3 id="structures">6. CWRC ontological structures</h3>
        
    <p>The Orlando source data contains multiple types of data which
    includes annotations on source text, factual information and 
    information about specific life events. The CWRC linked open data set 
    represents this information
    as a series of cultural formations and cultural contexts.</p>
    
    <p>While full, integrated traceability has always been a core need of
    repeatable experiments, this comes as a complexity cost within linked
    open data set in that the queries required to retrieve basic information
    become unwieldy. To this end the CWRC ontology records information in
    two different ways: through a series of <a href="#Context">Contexts</a>
    that link the information to its original Orlando text and a series of
    granular properties that simply link individuals to their personal attributes. In
    this way, both rapid retrieval and deep provenance tracking can be
    achieved.</p>


    <p>Two basic structures are used within the ontology to achieve this: <a
    href="#Context">Contexts</a> and <a href="#CulturalFormation">Cultural Formations<a/>.
    A cultural formation represent elements of lived social subjectivities
    and/or classification of people such as Race, Gender, Religion, etc.
    Contexts are used to link a fragment of Orlando prose to the individual
    it is referencing as well as to the specific cultural formation that is
    being assigned to the person. In addition, properties are separated in
    two categories: reported and self-reported, allowing for the
    qualification of individual statements.</p>

    <h4 id="culturalformationsontology">a. Cultural Formations</h4>    

 <p>The <a href="#CulturalFormation">Cultural Formation<a/> classes
 recognize categorization as endemic to social experience, while
 incorporating variation in terminology and contextualization of identity
 categories by employing instances at different discursive levels.</p>  
 
 <p>Cultural Formation sub-classes and instances describe the subject positions 
 of individuals through both <a href="#Context">Context</a>s and granular
 properties. This arrangements has its roots in the Orlando arrangement of
 Cultural Formations encodings that pointed users towards a framework for 
 raising and debating complex matters for cultural investigation rather than standardized
classifications, refusing to neatly group writers into distinct and fixed
categories, since those categories were neither stable nor mutually
exclusive (<a href="#Algee-Hewitt:2016aa">Algee-Hewitt, 2016</a>).</p>

<p>With the shift to a linked open data approach an issue has been how to
make this approach compatible with linkages to other ontologies and data
sets outside of the Orlando reference. Furthermore, the move from "strings
to links" has created another set of issues in that strings such as White,
Black, English, etc... are in themselves ambiguous: White and Black can
represent race or ethnicity, while English can also be ethnicity,
nationality or a national heritage. Because Orlando uses these strings in
Cultural Formations specific to, for example, race or
ethnicity, this must be transferred to a specific Cultural Formation
instance. Thus, there exists Cultural Formation instances that cover <a
href="#whiteRace">white</a> as a race and <a href="#whiteEthnicity">white</a>
as an ethnicity. Lastly, there also exists a <a href="#whiteLabel">white</a>
label that be instantiated as either race or ethnicity, but not both.</p>

<p>This is departure from previous (non linked open data) controlled
vocabularies in that the appearance of the term (in this case "white") does
not determine the specific cultural formation in use, the term does. This
also means that linkages to other data sets or vocabularies can be
appropriately be made since multiple representations of the same concept are
present within the CWRC ontology. As a last resort, or for data mining
purposes, the term is also available as an concept whose actual Cultural
Formation is undecided amongst the CWRC defined options. This allows for
linkages to the ontology, such as can be required in text mining, which
committing to a specific interpretation immediately.</p>
 
    <h4 id="contextontology">b. Contexts</h4>    
 
       <h4 id="granularproperties">c. Granular Properties</h4> 
       
       <p>Granular properties are meant as a simpler means of reporting
       information about individuals and their personal properties, some of
       which are self-reported. Some of the reported properties also
       includes forebears.</p>


    <h4 id="taxonomiesontology">d. Built-in Taxonomies</h4>    
       <h5 id="religion_taxonomy">i. Religion</h5>
          <p>The original Orlando data makes religious reporting an difficult
       issue in that the original contexts did not differentiation between
       religious beliefs, membership within religious organizations and the
       explicit abscende of any religious belief.</p>
       <p>We use a taxonomy for enumerating these beliefs. The taxonomy in
       itself is SKOS based and represents a loose mixtures of the shared
       belief and historical offshots. also not that the religion class is
       also an skos concept scheme that has multiple topConcepts.</p>
       <p>Some relegious mouvements are organized and thus are also
       marked as foaf organizations</p>
       <p>Taxonomy attempts to trace both the theological and/or
       organizational ancestry of the belief system. This is a highly
       subjective process.</p>
       <p>The specific taxonomy is:
       <img src="figures/religionTaxonomy.png">  
       </p>
       
       <h5 id="genre_taxonomy">ii. Literary Genre</h5>
       <p>The CWRC ontology contains over 240 genres.</p> 
       
       <h5 id="gender_taxonomy">iii. Gender, Sex and Orientation</h5>
       
       <p>Depending on the situation, the Orlando tags may reference any
       combination of sex, gender and/or sexual orientation.</p>

    <h2 id="notesSKOS">9. CWRC Ontology Design Rules</h2>

    <p>Beyond the formalism of [citation on ontology design rules], the CWRC
    ontology follows the following design rules and styles:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>The contents of rdfs:labels tags are always in lowercase.</li>
    <li>Whenever possible, the original Orlando TEI tag equivalent is
    contained within the rdf:value tag of any term within the ontology.</li>
    <li>Whenever referencing a geographical location, use the most precise
    item within the database.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="notesSKOSOWL">10. Notes on SKOS and OWL</h2>
     <p>
     SKOS (Simple Knowledge Organization System) enjoys widespread popularity in the semantic web community as it provides simple
     terms for taxonomies without requiring reasoner support. Whenever appropriate, SKOS terms are inserted within this ontology
     to link terms to each other. However, since these terms are not ontologically powered, their scalability is limited since
     each additional layer of terms within a taxonomy requires another database query.</p>
     <p>  
     Some of the constructs within the CWRC ontology are deep and require reasoning support. OWL is the preferred means of using
     this ontology, though the usage of the terms, SKOS-style, is possible.

    <h2 id="conclusion">12. Conclusion and Future Work</h2>
    <p>
    This is a draft ontology that is very much in progress. It will continue to be developed, expanded, and revised as we
    discover the implications of how we have structured the ontology through using it to extract and explore our data, data and
    uses cases that necessitate expansion or refinement, and as new needs, understandings, and debates arise.

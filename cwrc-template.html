    <h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
    <p>
    Cultural diversity has been an increasing source of debate within the
    digital humanities community. The concentration within the Debates in
    Digital Humanities series (<a name="gold2016">Gold and Klein, 2016</a>) of pieces
    reflecting the increasing prominence of matters related to race, gender,
    cultural diversity and difference is but one marker of the extent to
    which diversity matters. The Orlando Project in feminist literary
    history incorporated an intersectional understanding of identity
    categories from the outset. Translating Orlandoâ€™s XML data into linked
    open data (LOD) to make it accessible, interoperable, and amenable to a
    range of analytical approaches (<a name="Brown:2016aa">Simpson and Brown</a>) requires an ontology
    that will serve both Orlando and the broader research community hosted
    by the Canadian Writing Research Collaboratory (CWRC). This document
    outlines the CWRC ontology design and the challenges of shifting from
    semi-structured to structured data.
    </p>

    <h3 id="status">Status of this Document</h3>
    <p>
      This document grows iteratively with modification made over
      time according to the amount of Orlando data translated and the
      ontological issues located over time. Continuity is ensured through 
      the use of deprecated classes and properties.

    <h3 id="goals">Basic ontological goals.</h3>

    <p>The Orlando source data contains multiple types of data which
    includes annotations on source text, factual information and 
    information about specific life events. The CWRC linked open data set 
    represents this information
    as a series of cultural formations and cultural contexts.</p>
    
    <p>While full, integrated tracebility has always been a core need of
    repeatable experiments, this comes as a complexity cost within linked
    open data set in that the queries required to retrieve basic information
    become unyieldy. To this end the CWRC ontology records information in
    two different ways: through a series of <a href="#Context">Contexts</a>
    that link the information to its original Orlando text and a series of
    granular properties that simply link individuals to their personal attributes. In
    this way, both rapid retreival and deep provenance tracking can be
    acheived.</p>

    <p>Two basic structures are used within the ontology to acheive this: <a
    href="#Context">Contexts</a> and <a href="#CulturalFormation">Cultural Formations<a/>.
    A cultural formation represent elements of lived social subjectivities
    and/or classification of people such as Race, Gender, Religion, etc.
    Contexts are used to link a fragment of Orlando prose to the indidvudual
    it is referencing as well as to the sepcific cultural formation that is
    being assigned to the person. In addition, properties are seperated in
    two categories: reported and self-reported, allowing for the
    qualification of individual statements.</p>
 
    <h4 id="links">Linkages to other ontologies.</h3>
 
    <p>Vocabulary reuse presented some challenges to the CWRC in that the
    specific intent of vocabularies is not always recorded and thus
    ambiguitiy in the intent of the author makes their reuse difficult. A
    typical example is that of religion where much ambiguity exists as to
    wheter the term actually represents 
    the religion as a belief system, the underlying religious organization, 
    the social behaviours it implies or any combination of the above.</p>
    <p>A the top level the CWRC ontology makes use of the following well know
    ontologies:
    <ol>
     <li>The FOAF ontology for the representation of people and
     organizations.</li>
     <li>The BIBO ontology for the representation of biliographic data.</li>
     <li>The TIME ontology for the representation of events and points in
     time where ISO8601/XML Schema times are not appropriate.</li>
     <li>The NIF-CORE ontology is used to contain and manipulate the text of
     the original Orlando entries.</li>
     <li>The Open Annotation Ontology is used to link the original Orlando
     text to specific <a href="#Context">Context</a>s.</li>
     <li>The SKOS vocabulary is use to represent taxonomical relationships
     within certain <a href="#CulturalFormation">Cultural Formation<a/>s and
     to fully document ontology terms.</li>
     <li>Some Dublin Core vocabulary terms are used for well known documentation
     tags such as &lt;dc:title&gt;.
    </ol>
    </p>    

    <p>The wholesale import of entire vocabularies within the CWRC ontology
    was likely to cause logical and ontological issues. To this end, we
    opted not to use the &lt;owl:import&gt; construct and to either
    link to vocabularies externally or to clone specific sets of terms from
    selected vocabularies.</p>

    <p>A specific example was with the <a href="#Religion">Religion<a/>
    class instances that were problematic. <it>Why are we using Getty over
    dbpedia again?<it></p>
            
    <p>This has allowed for the careful control of what
    statements are made within CWRC while leveraging the work of other
    projects.</p>   

    <h3 id="culturalformations">Cultural Formations.</h3>

 <p>The <a href="#CulturalFormation">Cultural Formation<a/> classes
 recognize categorization as endemic to social experience, while
 incorporating variation in terminology and contextualization of identity
 categories by employing instances at different discursive levels.</p>  
 
 <p>Cultural Formation subclasses and instances describe the subject positions 
 of individuals through both <a href="#Context">Context</a>s and granular
 properties. This arrangements has its roots in the Orlando arrangement of
 Cultural Formations encodings that pointed users towards a framework for 
 raising and debating complex matters for cultural investigation rather than standardized
classifications, refusing to neatly group writers into distinct and fixed
categories, since those categories were neither stable nor mutually
exclusive (<a href="#Algee-Hewitt:2016aa">Algee-Hewitt, 2016</a>).</p>

<p>With the shift to a linked open data approach an issue has been how to
make this approach compatible with linkages to other ontologies and data
sets outside of the Orlando reference. Furthermore, the move from "strings
to links" has created another set of issues in that strings such as White,
Black, English, etc... are in themselves ambiguous: White and Black can
represent race or etchnicity, while English can also be etchnicity,
nationality or a national heritage. Because Orlando uses these strings in
Cultural Formations specific to, for example, race or
etchnicity, this must be transferred to a specific Cultural Formation
instance. Thus, there exists Cultural Formation instances that cover <a
href="#whiteRace">white</a> as a race and <a href="#whiteEthnicity">white</a>
as an ethnicity. Lastly, there also exists a <a href="#whiteLabel">white</a>
label that be instantiated as either race or ethnicity, but not both.</p>

<p>This is departure from previous (non linked open data) controlled
vocabularies in that the appearance of the term (in this case "white") does
not determine the specific cultural formation in use, the term does. This
also means that linkages to other data sets or vocabularies can be
appropriatly be made since multiple representations of the same concept are
present within the CWRC ontology. As a last resort, or for data mining
purposes, the term is also available as an concept whose actual Cultural
Formation is undecided amongsth the CWRC defined options. This allows for
linkages to the ontology, such as can be required in text mining, which
commiting to a specific interpretation immediatly.</p>


       <h3 id="granularproperties">Granular Properties</h3> 
       
       <p>Granual properties are meant as a simpler means of reporting
       information about individuals and their personal properties, some of
       which are self-reported. Some of the reported properties also
       includes forebears.</p>


    <h3 id="context">Cultural Contexts</h3>
    
     <p>
     <a href="#Context">Context</a>s are a means of recording both the
     target of a cultural formation and the source text that was written by
     Orlando authors about the topic.

    <h2 id="notesSKOS">CWRC Ontology Design Rules</h2>

    <p>Beyond the formalism of [citation on ontology design rules], the CWRC
    ontology follows the following design rules and styles:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>The contents of rdfs:labels tags are always in lowercase.</li>
    <li>Whenever possible, the original Orlando TEI tag equivalent is
    contained within the rdf:value tag of any term within the ontology.</li>
    <li>Whenever referencing a geographical location, use the most precise
    item within the database.</li>
    </ul>

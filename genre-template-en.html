     <h3 id="introduction">1. Introduction</h3>
     
     <p>A part of the extensive bibliographic data provided by the Orlando
     project a large amount of genre information was created.</p>
     <p>Genre, Carolyn R. Miller contends in an influential article, does not inhere in “substance or form of discourse” but must rather be conceived of in terms of situationally-specific rhetorical action, although her definition is more complicated than this brief articulation would suggest, since she argues that “action encompasses both substance and form”
     (151,152).</p>
     <p>Two primary types of action are associated with genre. Miller addresses how particular speech acts or instances of discourse, that is, texts in a broad sense, come themselves to embody generic features; these, she argues, emerge from rhetorical situations which are social constructs by which private intentions are translated into socially recognizable and interpretable discursive acts (Miller 1984). But there is also the act of applying a generic label to a text, another kind of discursive act that operates in a wide range of contexts for different purposes. Generic categorization is foundational to literary studies, organizing both primary and secondary materials, defining specializations and literary movements, and playing a major role in the organization and articulation of literary theory, criticism, and history. As a major feature of library classification systems, genre labelling serves research across the disciplines. It organizes bookstores and publishers’ lists, and is used by readers to share and discuss their tastes in
     texts.</p>
     <p>Within these wide-ranging contexts, methods of categorizing specific texts by genre fall into a spectrum ranging from the application by professional cataloguers of tightly controlled authoritative vocabularies produced by “trusted sources” (Harper), though to entirely folksonomic categories devised ad hoc by users of online systems--what Clay Shirky has described as “a radical break with previous categorization strategies, rather than an extension of them.” Numerous studies have indicated that while the terms deployed in these various contexts may overlap, they are not consistently applied (Lester; Lu; Rolla). What will happen, then, when such different approaches to genre intersect, collide, or otherwise interact within a Linked Open Data (LOD) environment where they may be aggregated into a single
     interface?</p>

     
     <h3 id="genre_taxonomy">ii. Literary Genre</h3>
       <p>The taxonomy of literary genres is based on a SKOS approach that
       is geared towards information retrieval.</p> 
       <p>The specific taxonomy is:

    <p>
    This is a draft ontology that is very much in progress. It will continue to be developed, expanded, and revised as we
    discover the implications of how we have structured the ontology through using it to extract and explore our data, data and
    uses cases that necessitate expansion or refinement, and as new needs, understandings, and debates arise.

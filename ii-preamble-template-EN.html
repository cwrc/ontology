        <h1>CWRC Ontology Preamble</h1>
        <hr/>
        <h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
        <p>The Ontology of the Canadian Writing Research Collaboratory (<a href="http://www.cwrc.ca">cwrc.ca</a>) brings together various linked data materials produced within the Collaboratory related to the writers, writing, and culture.</p>

        <h2 id="introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>Although it contains quite general components for activities such as annotation and citation, the focus of the CWRC ontology is on describing and relating aspects of literary studies and literary history, with a strong emphasis on gender and intersectional analysis indebted to its roots in <a href="http://www.artsrn.ualberta.ca/orlando/">The Orlando Project, a history of women’s writing in the British Isles</a>. It links to a number of standards while attempting to indicate the complexity of the relationship between representation and provenance in the production of linked data, and to convey the situatedness (<a href="#cwrc:f62e94d6-bd04-494c-9282-53af0a3f3376">Haraway, 1988</a>) of the knowledge that it represents. </p>
        <p>Some of the materials associated with this ontology are produced natively by activities conducted within the Collaboratory. Others are produced through a process of translation from embedded XML markup. In other words, some are the product of human creation or curation, and others are generated by machine. </p>

        <h2 id="status">2. About this Document</h2>
        <p>This document is a human-readable version of the ontology that cannot document all of its data structures. The ontology itself should be the primary source for understanding how the ontology works. </p>
        <p>The intended audience of this document is the scholar that wishes to understand how the ontology tackles concrete data recording problems and the linked open data practitioner that intends to make use of this ontology. </p>

        <h2 id="status_ontology">3. Status of this dynamic ontology</h2>
        <p>This document and the associated ontology will grow iteratively with modifications made over time as data is progressively translated and further ontological concerns are identified. Continuity is ensured using the OWL ontology annotations for ontological compatibility and for deprecated classes and properties. Deprecated ontology terms remain present but are marked as such. </p><p>The ontology is understood to be a living document that makes no claims to completeness. Instances in particular have been derived from particular datasets and will be expanded progressively over time. </p><p>We welcome suggestions for new classes, properties, and predicates from those wishing to use the ontology for their own datasets, as well as suggestions related to the complexity of vocabulary associated with existing terms. Please submit suggestions via an issue or a pull request to the <a href="https://github.com/cwrc/ontology">CWRC Ontology code repository</a>.</p>

        <h2 id="goals">4. Basic ontological goals</h2>

        <h3 id="principals">a. Principles</h3>
        <p>The schema covers entities, classes, and relationships associated with the domains of literature and literary and cultural history as understood from an intersectional feminist perspective. The ontology design responds to the challenges of shifting from semi-structured to structured data (<a href="#cwrc:26ad3610-a0bb-4e62-8fbc-d6be9ccbbdf6">Smith, 2013</a>). Although linked data triples stand on their own formally, many are derived from discursive prose and are best read in an environment that links back to their original context. The CWRC ontology design avoids representing RDF extractions from Orlando data as positivist assertions, and yet produces machine-readable OWL/RDF-compliant graph structures. It allows references to, without endorsing, external ontological vocabularies that are nevertheless part of documenting cultural processes and identities.</p>

        <h3 id="linkages">d. Linkages to external ontologies</h3>
        <p>We employ a number of strategies for linking to other ontologies. Our architecture does not typically import other ontologies wholesale, but relates to large vocabularies in defined ways. We try not to abuse sameAs predicates (<a href="#cwrc:a5686049-f450-415c-9ca6-deee26e30899">Halpin, Hayes et al., 2010</a>).</p>
        <p> We adopt external namespaces and associated classes and terms wherever possible when they are in widespread use and their vocabularies are broadly compatible with ours, as in the case of the <a href="http://xmlns.com/foaf/spec/">FOAF</a> and <a href="http://bibliontology.com/">BIBO</a> vocabularies. For some terms, such as those for religious denominations or genres, we are happy to draw on other vocabularies’ terms and definitions in part or in whole, as in the case of terms from the <a href="#cwrc:db2f8571-a773-4068-a35f-34262950bb8f">Getty Art and Architecture Thesaurus</a> (<a href="http://www.getty.edu/research/index.html">Getty Research Institute</a>). Other terms are referenced, but usually at a distance rather than through wholesale import. This is particularly common in relation to <a href="cwrc.html#CulturalForm">cultural forms</a>, which, as explained more fully below, are understood primarily as representational and linked, where multiple related terms exist within the ontology, to terms typed as <a href="cwrc.html#TextLabels">textual labels</a>. By means of this structure, our vocabulary positions all terms associated with processes of Cultural Form as discursive labels, retaining the ambiguity of terms implicated in the complex social construction of identities within a narrative. Cultural forms may in turn be related to external ontologies in a number of ways. If an external ontology term aligns semantically with ours, then we use OWL- or SKOS-based relationships such as <code>&lt;owl:equivalentClass&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;skos:narrower&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;skos:broader&gt;</code>. If an external term's definition or use is not commensurate with a term in the CWRC ontology but its application in external datasets is such that it will be useful nevertheless to link those terms to ours (for instance for broadening searches using the problematic ISO5218 <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/36266.html">Codes for the representation of human sexes</a>), then the <a href="cwrc.html#hasFunctionalRelation">has functional relation</a> predicate is employed to indicate that the relationship is specified semantically but may be leveraged for processing.</p>
        <p>At the top level, the CWRC ontology makes use of the following well known ontologies:
          <ol>
            <li>The <a href="http://xmlns.com/foaf/spec/">FOAF</a> ontology for the representation of people and organizations.</li>
            <li>The <a href="http://bibliontology.com/">BIBO</a> ontology for the representation of bibliographic data.</li>
            <li>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/owl-time/">TIME</a> ontology for the representation of events and points in time where <a href="https://www.w3.org/XML/Schema">ISO8601/XML Schema times</a> are not appropriate.</li>
            <li>The <a href="http://persistence.uni-leipzig.org/nlp2rdf/ontologies/nif-core/nif-core.html">NIF-CORE</a> ontology is used to contain and manipulate the text of the original Orlando entries.</li>
            <li>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/">Web Open Annotation</a> data model is used to link the original Orlando text to specific <a href="cwrc.html#Context">Contexts</a>.</li>
            <li>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/">SKOS</a> vocabulary is used to represent taxonomical relationships within certain <a href="cwrc.html#CulturalForm">Cultural Form</a>s and to fully document ontology terms.</li>
            <li>Some <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/">Dublin Core</a> vocabulary terms are used for well known documentation tags such as <code>&lt;dc:title&gt;</code>.</li>
            <li>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-overview/">W3C Provenance ontology</a> is used to indicate indebtedness, derivation or provenance of term descriptions as well as Cultural Context source annotations. </li>
            <li>Linkages are made to the <a href="http://www.cidoc-crm.org/">CIDOC-CRM</a> ontology to cultural instances that are in common with CWRC.</li>
          </ol>
        </p>
        <p>Established ontologies and vocabularies are used in the definition of numerous classes and instances. For instance, the religious terms of the <a href="http://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/aat/">Getty Art and Architecture Thesaurus</a> provide suitable definitions for many religions, as does <a href="http://dbpedia.org/">DBPedia</a> for many terms throughout the ontology. Sometimes definitions draw on scholarly print and online sources. Quotation marks around the text of the description indicate wholesale adoption of the source definition. Where the description is surrounded by quotation marks, the term has been defined by the CWRC team, but links to may be provided to external resources such as a scholarly article or closely related DBpedia entry.</p>
        <p>In other cases, terms from external ontologies are adopted in CWRC datasets without having been imported into our ontology. What follows is a non-exhaustive list of such vocabularies and the classes for which they are most frequently used:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><a href="http://geonames.org/">Geonames</a> terms are often used for locations and for many instances of <i><a href="cwrc.html#GeographicHeritage">geographic heritage</a></i>.</li>
          <li><a href="http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/languages.html">Library of Congress Languages</a> codes are typically used for instances of <i><a href="cwrc.html#Language">language</a></i>.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3 id="provenance">e. Provenance and contexts</h3>
        <p>As noted above, some data associated with this ontology has been generated from XML structures (<a href="#cwrc:aaa909f5-ffb5-4995-8245-b169d3c64746">Simpson and Brown, 2013</a>). Provenance is thus particularly important, given that such data was not produced natively in RDF but rather in the form of tags embedded in a discursive context. In such cases, the relevant portions of the text are provided in the form of snippets, which within the dataset become instances of contextual notes or human-readable annotations to which the data set nodes are directly tied. </p>
        <p>The wholesale import of entire vocabularies within the CWRC ontology was likely to cause logical and ontological problems. To this end, we opted not to use the <code>&lt;owl:import&gt;</code> construct and instead either to link to vocabularies externally or to clone specific sets of terms from selected vocabularies. Similarly, not all vocabularies are well-defined from an ontological standpoint, but drawing from their narrative or some of their properties proved useful. To this end, we avoided the use of <code>&lt;owl:sameAs&gt;</code> so as not to bring unintended properties or ontological structures into the CWRC ontology. In other cases, the Provenance ontology property <code>&lt;prov:wasDerivedFrom&gt;</code> is used to indicate that the term was constructed using information from other terms without necessarily being equivalent. Direct linkages to other ontologies are usually made through the use of subClasses or <code>&lt;owl:equivalentClass&gt;</code>.</p>


        <h3 id="labels">f. Labels</h3>
        <p>For labelling, CWRC utilizes two schemes to promote searchability. <code>rdfs:label</code> represents the humen-readable nomenclature for a concept, instance, or predicate. This is the terminology used when representing components of the ontology in documentation and diagrams, except where a URI is provided.</p><p>As noted above in relation to <a href="cwrc.html#CulturalForm">cultural form</a>, however, when <a href="cwrc.html#TextLabels">textual label</a> is used to type a class, this is an indication of the representationality or discursivity of that class. <code>cwrc:TextLabels</code> are frequently used for ambivalent, overlapping, and culturally contested terms.</p>
        <p>In addition, to support those with knowledge of prior datasets whose strings or terms have been linked for extraction purposes to CWRC terms, the ontology provides additional linguistic context for CWRC ontology terms. Alternative labels, signified by <code>skos:altLabel</code>, indicate terms from source datasets that have been employed to create relationships to this concept. Alt labels typically cannot serve as replacements for rdfs:label. Within the ontology, such alternative labels primarily exist for search and retrieval by allowing ontology terms to be located under a larger number of labels. Although some reflect the idiosyncrasies of the source data, they may be useful for broadening searches.</p>

          <!-- <figcaption>Figure 3 - Change Set Example using both external descriptions and internal descriptions</figcaption> -->
        </figure>


        <h2 id="structures">6. CWRC ontological structures</h2>
        <p>Source data from CWRC spans multiple types of data including annotations on source texts, meta-data, granular material such as bibliography, and discursive and analytical content about specific life events and literary phenomena. The CWRC linked open data set represents such information as series of assertions, frequently associated with particular contexts.</p>
        <p>While full, integrated traceability has always been a core need of repeatable experiments, this comes at a complexity cost within a linked open data set in that the queries required to retrieve basic information become unwieldy. To this end, the CWRC ontology records information in two different ways: through a series of <a href="cwrc.html#Context">Contexts</a> that link the information to its associated source text in Orlando or other materials, and through a series of granular properties that simply link individuals to their personal attributes. In this way, both rapid retrieval and deep provenance tracking are enabled.</p>
        <p>The major structure used within the ontology to achieve this is <a href="cwrc.html#Context">Context</a>s combined with the typing of contexts according to a number of high-level classes such as <a href="cwrc.html#CulturalForm">Cultural Form</a>. Contexts are used to link a fragment of Orlando prose to the individual whom it references, the properties or assertions situated within that context, and the class of experience or activity to which it belongs.</p>

<!--  
        <h3 id="taxonomiesontology">d. Built-in Taxonomies</h3>
    <h4 id="religion_taxonomy">i. Religion</h4>
    <p>The original Orlando data makes religious reporting a challenge in that the original contexts had no differentiation between religious belief, membership in a religious organization, and absence of any religious belief combined with adherence to values or practices.</p>
    <p>We use a taxonomy for enumerating the categories associated with this spectrum. The taxonomy in itself is SKOS-based and represents a loose mixture of the shared beliefs and historical offshoots.</p>
    <p>The taxonomy attempts to trace in a subjective way the theological and/or historical lineage of the belief system. Like applying the labels to an individual, this is an interpretive process.</p>
    <p><a href="figures/religionTaxonomy-ONTOLOGY_DATE-EN.svg">The specific taxonomy is:</a></p>
    <object type="image/svg+xml" id="religion-tax" data="figures/religionTaxonomy-ONTOLOGY_DATE-EN.svg"></object>


Alliyya:
  May eventually want to add some taxonomy graphs or such, 
  once I have fixed up docgen, I'll see what can be mocked up with my taxonomy generator

But if you'd like to add in any visualizations from protege that you're keen on we can display those as well
      -->

        <h2 id="notesSKOS">7. CWRC Ontology Design Rules</h2>
        <p>Beyond the formalism of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/owl-primer/">The OWL 2 Web Ontology Language</a>, the CWRC ontology follows the following design rules and styles:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The contents of rdfs:labels tags are always in lowercase, with the
          following exceptions:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Labels for religions, political affiliations and groups of people derived from a proper name will begin with an uppercase letter.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Whenever possible, the original Orlando XML tag equivalent is contained within the rdf:value tag of any term within the ontology.</li>
          <li>Whenever referencing a geographical location, use the most precise item within the database.</li>
          <li>Definitions in French, English (and other serendipitously available languages) are never word for word translations, and are definitions in their own right.</li>
        </ul>


        <h2 id="notesSKOSOWL">8. Notes on SKOS and OWL</h2>
        <p>SKOS (Simple Knowledge Organization System) enjoys widespread popularity in the semantic web community as it provides simple terms for taxonomies without requiring reasoner support. Whenever appropriate, SKOS terms are inserted within this ontology to link terms to each other. However, since these terms are not ontologically powered, their scalability is limited since each additional layer of terms within a taxonomy requires another database query.</p>
        <p>Some of the constructs within the CWRC ontology are deep and require reasoning support. OWL is the preferred means of using this ontology, though the usage of the terms, SKOS-style, is possible.
        </p>


        <h2 id="conclusion">9. Conclusion and Future Work</h2>
        <p>This is a draft ontology that is very much in progress. It will continue to be developed, expanded, and revised as we discover the implications of how we have structured the ontology through using it to extract and explore our data, as fresh data and use cases necessitate expansion or refinement, and as new needs, understandings, and debates arise. </p>
